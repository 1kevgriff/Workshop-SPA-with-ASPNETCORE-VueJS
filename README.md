# Workshop: Building Single Page Applications with VueJS and ASP.NET Core

## What you'll learn

## Prerequisites

## The "Goal" Project
In this workshop, we are going to build a simple application to management multiple To Do lists and items.

There will be three primary views:

* The List of Lists
* To Dos for a given list
* Create or Edit a To Do

> Note: The goal of this workshop isn't to build something "pretty".  In fact, the views will be pretty rough!  But they'll work!
