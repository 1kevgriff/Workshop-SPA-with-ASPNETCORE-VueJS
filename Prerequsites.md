# Prerequisites

Welcome to the workshop!  We're going to do our best to keep this as painless as possible for you, but there are a couple things we need to ensure you have preinstalled on your machine before we begin.

If you have any questions about the installables, please file an issue or shoot me an email (kevin at consultwithgriff.com)

## Installables

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3. [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/getting-started)

4. [Install .NET 5 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/net-core-sdk-current)

> You might be asking yourself, does this workshop still support .NET Core 3.1 since it's the current LTS version?  Sure does!  If you're running 3.1 still, that's fine.  Either works for the needs of this workshop.
